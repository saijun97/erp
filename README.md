# Multi-Cloud-based ERP System

A Web-based ERP System that was developed for my final year dissertation project to support the business processes of BBCwyse Technology Co. Ltd. A full stack java framework named CUBA Platform was used to develop the system and it was deployed to Salesforce Heroku Cloud Application platform. An instance of the Postgres database and the SendGrid Email API (Mail Server) was also provisioned as the systemâ€™s underlying components. Amazon S3 was also configured and integrated to the system to act as its file storage service for user uploads and attachments while GitHub was used as the version control system/code respository from which changes to the staging and production environments could be continuously deployed and integrated (CI/CD). The system also featured an integration with the Emtel Web-to-SMS Gateway for automated SMS notifications and was secured using CloudFlare SSL.
