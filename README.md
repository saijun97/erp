# Multi-Cloud-based ERP System

This is the repository for all the source files relating to the web based ERP system that was developed as partial fulfilments for the course BSc(Hons) Electronics with computer science for my final year project.

The system was developed using a java framework named cuba platform and was implemented using a custom multi-cloud architecture.
